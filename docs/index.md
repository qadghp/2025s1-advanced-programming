# Advanced Programming

This course brings resources from multiples sources.

## Description
The Advanced Programming course trains students to develop complex and efficient programs. It begins with a review of fundamental concepts of imperative and modular programming, addressing basic and advanced data structures, such as linked lists, stacks, queues, binary trees, and heaps.  It delves deeper into Object Oriented Programming (OOP), covering classes, inheritance, encapsulation, and polymorphism. In addition, it includes coroutines, performance optimization techniques, and version control with Git.

## Course Contribution to Professional Training

- Ability to build basic algorithms using modular programming, essential for solving real-world problems and understanding code reuse. 
- Ability to build algorithms using object-oriented programming, essential for solving real-world problems and understanding inheritance, encapsulation, and polymorphism.  
- Experience in properly using pointers and files; this is useful for understanding courses such as - Operating Systems and Computer Networks. 
- Experience in implementing dynamic data structures (stacks, queues), which is a good starting point for - Algorithm Analysis and Object-Oriented Programming.

## Course Objectives

- Apply advanced imperative programming concepts to solve complex problems using sequences, decisions, and loops effectively. 
- Design and structure modular programs using functions and libraries, promoting efficient code reuse and organization. 
- Implement and manipulate advanced data structures, such as linked lists, stacks, queues, binary trees, and heaps, to efficiently manage and process data. 
- Use Object Oriented Programming (OOP) principles, including classes, inheritance, encapsulation, and polymorphism, to create scalable, maintainable, and robust applications. 
- Manage software projects using version control with Git. 
- Apply performance optimization techniques to improve the efficiency and scalability of developed applications. 
- Document and test programs rigorously, ensuring software reliability and quality.
